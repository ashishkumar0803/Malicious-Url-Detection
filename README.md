## Malicious URL Detection - Machine Learning Project

**Project Overview**

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the rise of sophisticated cyber attacks demands innovative and proactive solutions. Malicious URLs are commonly used in cyber attacks, including phishing schemes and malware distribution. Detecting and mitigating these threats is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information, personal privacy, and maintaining digital security.

This project aims to develop a machine learning system that accurately identifies URLs with malicious intent, mitigating risks such as phishing and malware attacks.

**Objectives**
  - Achieve high accuracy in classifying malicious URLs, minimizing false positives.
  - Reduce detection time, preventing users from accessing harmful URLs.
  - Adapt to evolving threats by learning new malicious URL patterns.

**Machine Learning Approach**
  -To ensure robust detection, the project explored various machine learning classifiers:
    -Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes
    -Logistic Regression
    -Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
    -Decision Trees
    -Random Forest
    -Support Vector Machine (SVM)
